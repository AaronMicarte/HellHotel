3. **Front desk assigns rooms** â†’ Specific room numbers assigned to room types
4. **Booking can be confirmed** â†’ Status changes to Confirmed
5. **Room status updates** â†’ Assigned rooms marked as Reserved

#### **Room Assignment Rules**
- Only available rooms of the correct type can be assigned
- Companions are preserved per room during assignment
- Multiple rooms can be assigned to one reservation
- Room status updates automatically when booking is confirmed
