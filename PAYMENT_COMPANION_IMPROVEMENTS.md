# Online Booking System Improvements - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Payment Structure Modernization**

#### **Frontend Changes (booking-form.js)**
- ✅ Removed `on_hold_payment_info` from reservation payload

- ✅ Payment proof and reference number sent directly to Payment table

#### **Backend Changes (payments.php)**
- ✅ Added `insertOnHoldPayment` operation
- ✅ Handles file upload for payment proof
- ✅ Creates payment record with status 1 (on hold)
- ✅ Stores proof URL and reference number directly in Payment table

### 2. **Companion Handling Improvements**

#### **Backend Changes (reservations.php)**
- ✅ Enhanced companion saving for both single and multi-room bookings
- ✅ Added support for companions with room mapping (room_type_id + room_index)
- ✅ Companions now saved at booking time, not just during room assignment
- ✅ Fixed multi-room companion association logic

### 3. **Database Schema Cleanup**

#### **SQL Migration**
- ✅ Created `remove_on_hold_payment_info_column.sql`
- ✅ Removed `on_hold_payment_info` column from Reservation table
- ✅ Updated all SQL queries to remove references to obsolete column

#### **Backend Updates**
- ✅ Updated `confirmAndCreateBilling` function to work with Payment table
- ✅ Changed payment confirmation to update existing payment record instead of creating new one
- ✅ Removed all references to `on_hold_payment_info` in reservations.php

### 4. **Admin Interface Updates**

#### **Frontend Changes (online-bookings.js)**
- ✅ Updated payment info display to fetch from Payment table
- ✅ Added payment data fetching to reservation details
- ✅ Modified on-hold payment detection to use Payment table
- ✅ Enhanced reservation data loading with payment information

## New Workflow

### **Guest Online Booking Process:**
1. Guest fills booking form with room selections and companions
2. Companions are mapped to specific rooms (room_type_id + room_index)
3. Payment proof and reference are uploaded/entered
4. **Two API calls made:**
   - Reservation + companions created in reservations.php
   - Payment record created in payments.php with status "on hold"
5. No JSON payment data stored in Reservation table

### **Admin Confirmation Process:**
1. Admin views online bookings with on-hold payment status
2. Payment information fetched from Payment table (not JSON)
3. When confirming:
   - Billing record created
   - Existing payment record updated to "confirmed" status
   - Reservation status changed to "confirmed"
   - No clearing of JSON fields (they don't exist anymore)

## Benefits Achieved

### **Data Integrity:**
- ✅ Payment information properly normalized in Payment table
- ✅ Companions correctly associated with specific rooms
- ✅ No duplicate or orphaned data
- ✅ Clean database schema without legacy JSON fields

### **Functionality:**
- ✅ Companions saved at booking time (visible to admin immediately)
- ✅ Payment proof and reference accessible via standard queries
- ✅ On-hold payments properly tracked and confirmable
- ✅ Multi-room bookings with per-room companions supported

### **Maintainability:**
- ✅ Consistent data structure across booking types
- ✅ Standard Payment table operations
- ✅ Reduced code complexity (no JSON parsing)
- ✅ Better error handling and debugging

## Files Modified

### **Core Files:**
- `assets/js/guest/booking-form.js` - Guest booking frontend
- `api/admin/payments/payments.php` - Payment backend
- `api/admin/reservations/reservations.php` - Reservation backend
- `assets/js/admin/online-bookings.js` - Admin management interface

### **Database:**
- `remove_on_hold_payment_info_column.sql` - Schema cleanup migration

### **Test File:**
- `test_new_booking_flow.html` - End-to-end testing interface

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL migration:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute in your database
   source remove_on_hold_payment_info_column.sql;
   ```

2. **Test the new flow:**
   - Open `test_new_booking_flow.html` in browser
   - Submit test booking with companions and payment proof
   - Verify in admin interface that companions and payment info are visible
   - Test payment confirmation process

3. **Validation checklist:**
   - [ ] Online bookings save companions correctly
   - [ ] Payment info stored in Payment table
   - [ ] Admin can see payment proof and reference
   - [ ] Confirmation process works without errors
   - [ ] Multi-room bookings with companions work
   - [ ] No references to `on_hold_payment_info` remain

## Database Impact

**Before:** Payment info stored as JSON in `Reservation.on_hold_payment_info`
**After:** Payment info stored as proper records in `Payment` table with relationships

This provides better data integrity, easier querying, and more robust payment tracking.
