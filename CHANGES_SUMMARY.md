# Summary of Changes for Overdue Reservations Display

## Files Modified:

### 1. `/api/admin/reservations/reservations.php`
- **Change**: Updated the "confirmed" view filter to include 'overdue' status
- **Line**: Modified the WHERE clause to include `'overdue'` in the status list
- **Effect**: Overdue reservations will now appear in the main reservations table

### 2. `/assets/js/admin/reservations.js`
- **Changes Made**:
  - `getStatusBadge()`: Already handles 'overdue' with red warning triangle icon
  - `renderStatusFlowIcons()`: Already prevents actions for overdue reservations (shows static icon)
  - `updateReservationStatsOverview()`: Already includes overdue count in statistics
  - Updated comment in `displayReservations()` to reflect that overdue is now included

### 3. `/html/admin/reservations.html`  
- **Change**: Added "Overdue" statistics card with dark border
- **Effect**: Shows count of overdue reservations in the stats overview

## What You'll See After Running the SQL Script:

### 1. In the Statistics Cards:
- New "Overdue" card showing count of overdue reservations
- All stats will be fetched dynamically from the database

### 2. In the Reservations Table:
- Overdue reservations will appear with:
  - Red warning triangle icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) and "Overdue" status
  - No action buttons in the Status Flow column (just a static overdue icon)
  - All other information displayed normally

### 3. Automatic Behavior:
- When page loads/refreshes: Automatically checks for and updates overdue reservations
- Reservations past their checkout date will be automatically marked as overdue
- Status filter dropdown will include "Overdue" as an option
- Search functionality will work with overdue reservations

## Status Flow Logic:
- **Cancelled**: Shows ban icon (üö´), no actions available
- **Overdue**: Shows warning triangle (‚ö†Ô∏è), no actions available  
- **Other statuses**: Show appropriate action buttons as before

## Next Steps:
1. Run the `add_overdue_status.sql` script in your database
2. Refresh the reservations page
3. Verify that overdue reservations appear in the table with proper styling
4. Test that the statistics update correctly including the overdue count

The implementation ensures that overdue reservations are clearly visible but cannot be modified through the status flow, maintaining data integrity while providing clear visibility of reservation status.
